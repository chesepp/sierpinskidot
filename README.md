if you need a sierpinski triangle drawn using win32 i am your guy, this is the second version i have made. however this one uses my OWN math to make the triangle
you can try this out in real life too. draw points of the verticies of an equallateral triangle, then draw a dot anywhere inside the triangle. find the mid point between the dot inside the triangle and a random point of the triangles verticies and draw a point there, and repeat.

for this program type a number for how many points you want the triangle to be made out of. Use larger numbers for more detail. At about 2000 the rough shape starts to be present. then press enter to start drawing the triangle.
